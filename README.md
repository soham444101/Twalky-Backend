# 🛰️ Twalky Meet (Backend)

This backend powers the **Twalky Meet** application — a real-time video meeting system built with **WebRTC** and **Socket.IO**.  
It manages **session creation**, **user participation**, and **peer-to-peer signaling** between connected users.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ Real-time WebSocket signaling using **Socket.IO**
- 📞 Peer-to-peer WebRTC offer/answer handling
- ❄️ ICE candidate forwarding between peers
- 👥 Session creation, validation & participant management
- 🗄️ MongoDB storage for sessions
- 🛡️ Express with CORS & JSON middleware
- 🧹 Graceful shutdown handling
- 🧠 Scalable backend structure

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/twalky-meet-backend.git
cd twalky-meet-backend
````

---

### 2️⃣ Create `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following values:

```env
MONGO_URL="your_mongodb_connection_string"
PORT=5000
```

> 💡 Replace `"your_mongodb_connection_string"` with your MongoDB URI (from MongoDB Atlas or local setup).

---

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 4️⃣ Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

> ✅ Server will run on `http://localhost:5000`
> WebSocket will be active on the same URL.

## 🧪 Example Socket Flow

1. User A joins → `join-session`
2. User B joins → `new-participant` event sent to A
3. A creates offer → sends via `send-offer`
4. B receives offer → creates answer → sends `send-answer`
5. Both exchange ICE candidates via `send-ice-candidate`
6. Connection established 🎥

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

* Ensure **MongoDB** is running and accessible before starting the backend.
* WebRTC communication requires the frontend to exchange SDP (offer/answer) correctly.
* Keep the **Socket.IO version** consistent across frontend and backend.
* Use `ngrok` or a similar tunneling service to test on physical devices.
